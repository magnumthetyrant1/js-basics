/*
GAME RULES:
  1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
  2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
  2.1. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
  3. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
  4. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

  Challenges:
  1. A player loses his/her entire score when rolling two sixes in a row.
  2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score so that they can change the predifined score of 100
  3. Add another dice to the game so that there are two dice. The player loses their current score if one of the die is 1.
