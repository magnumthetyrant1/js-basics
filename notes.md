# Notes

## Variables

1. Type coercion: JS will concatenate two variables and try to determine what the type should be
2. Changing the value of a variable is called variable mutation
3. Operator Precedence: which operator will be executed first

## DOM Manipulation

1. document -> the context for any dom Manipulation
2. querySelector() -> returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
  2.1. SYNTAX_ERR => if the specified selectors are invalid.
  2.2. Additional Documentation can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector#Examples
